AoE2 DE-like keymap for AoE2 Forgotten Empires 

## How to use it

Download the file player.hmi and put it in the same folder AOEII, where the AoFE_Launcher.exe is.
There could be several playerX.hki files, where X is the player number. If you're not sure which is the number of the player you're playing as, copy the player.hki and player2.hki, player3.hki etc replacing all the playerX.hki files.
